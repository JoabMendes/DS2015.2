#CORBA Implementation using Python (Unix)

This is an example of a CORBA implementation using python.

#Requirements

To run this example you will need the omniORB and omniORBpy libraries.
This middleware allows you to implement interfaces for python applications
using the CORBA technology. To install these libraries follow the commands
of this [tutorial(in mandarim)](http://blog.csdn.net/kmust20093211/article/details/43528109)
(This tutorial also explains how to define the omniNames, but in my example I used the IORs
directly in the clients).

You also need to have the fortune cookie program installed

`$ sudo apt-get install fortune`

Config the lybrary path as well:

`$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib`

To test run the python shell and try to import the libraries:

`>>>> import CORBA `
`>>>> from omniORB import CORBA`

#Running

To run this example you will first need to compile the idl. Using omniORBpy run:

`$ omniidl -bpython fortune.idl`

And them run the server

`python server.py`

This will generate and IOR number that will be the object reference for the
clients, it could be the same as the omniName, but to simplify the example
copy the string generate by the server and sign it to the variable `ior` in
the client script.

After this just run the client:

`python client.py`


This will give you a quote generated by the fortune program requested from
the server script.
