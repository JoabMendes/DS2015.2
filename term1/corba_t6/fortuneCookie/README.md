#CORBA Implementation using Python and Perl (Unix)

This is an example of a CORBA implementation using python for the server application
and perl for the client.

#Requirements

## For python
To run this example you will need the omniORB and omniORBpy libraries for the python server.
This middleware allows you to implement interfaces for python applications
using the CORBA technology. To install these libraries follow the commands
of this [tutorial(in mandarim)](http://blog.csdn.net/kmust20093211/article/details/43528109)
(This tutorial also explains how to define the omniNames, but in my example I used the IORs
directly in the clients).

You also need to have the fortune cookie program installed

`$ sudo apt-get install fortune`

Config the lybrary path as well:

`$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib`

To test run the python shell and try to import the libraries:

`>>>> import CORBA `
`>>>> from omniORB import CORBA`

## For perl
The needed library to run the client application in perl is the [ORBit2](https://projects.gnome.org/ORBit2/).
It has a full documentation explaning how to install and run a corba example in perl.
The difference between this middleware and the omniORBpy is that we don't have to compile or build anything
to run the example after the intallation and configuration. The application imports the IDL
directly and the middleware will handle it by itself.


#Running

To run this example you will first need to compile the idl. Using omniORBpy run:

`$ omniidl -bpython fortune.idl`

And them run the server

`python server.py`

This will generate and IOR number that will be the object reference for the
clients, it could be the same as the omniName, but to simplify the example
copy the string generate by the server and sign it to the variable `ior` in
the client script.

After this just run the client:

`perl perl_client.pl`

This will give you a quote generated by the fortune program requested from
the server script.
